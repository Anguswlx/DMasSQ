# Diffusion Models as Stochastic Quantization in Lattice Field Theory

It's a note book for demonstrating how the Diffusiom Models can be applied into the scalar phi-4 theory.
 
The contents of this notebook are mainly based on the following paper,

Diffusion Models as Stochastic Quantization in Lattice Field Theory, L Wang, G Aarts, K Zhou, [arXiv:2309.17082[hep-lat]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17082)

## Getting Started

    The code requires Python >= 3.8 and PyTorch >= 2.0. You can configure on CPU machine and accelerate with a recent Nvidia GPU card.

The [notebook](DMasSQ_open.ipynb) is self-contained and can be run on your local machine. You can also run it on Google Colab.
